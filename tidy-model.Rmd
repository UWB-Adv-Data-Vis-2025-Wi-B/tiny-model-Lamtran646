## Introduction

This R Markdown document demonstrates my abilities to use models for data analysis using a data set collected on crickets.

```{r load data, include = FALSE}
data(crickets, package = "modeldata")
names(crickets)
```

## What is that sound?

In this report, we examine what factors a cricket's chirp rate.

```{r summary, echo = FALSE}
summary(crickets)
``` 

The number of observations in the data set is 31. The number of species is 2. The temperate range is a minimum of 17.20 and a maximum of 30.40. The mean rate of chirping is 72.89.
